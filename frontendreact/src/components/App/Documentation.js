            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                FantasyWaterLeague is a fantasy sports game that allows users to draft a team of stream gauges, rain gauges, and groundwater wells. The game is played over a set period of time, and the team with the highest score at the end of the game wins. The score is calculated based on the performance of the team's gauges and wells.

                FantasyWaterLeague is hosted and developed by the New Mexico Water Data Initiative (NMWDI). The NMWDI is a collaborative effort between the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission. The NMWDI is funded by the New Mexico Governor's Water Resiliency and Innovation Council (WRIC).</p>
